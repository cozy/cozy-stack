## What is Cozy?

![Cozy Logo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/cozy/cozy-guidelines/master/templates/cozy_logo_small.svg)

[Cozy](https://cozy.io) is a platform that brings all your web services in the
same private space. With it, your web apps and your devices can share data
easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own
hardware where no one profiles you.


## What is the Cozy-Stack

It is the core server of the Cozy platform. It consists of a single process, *the Cozy stack*. 

[Full Cozy-Stack documentation here](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/).

The Cozy-Stack is in charge of serving the Web applications users have installed from the application store.

It provides its services through a REST API that allows to:

 - create, update, delete documents inside the database;
 - authenticate users and client applications;
 - send emails;
 - launch jobs on the server. Connectors that import data from remote websites are some sort of jobs. Jobs can be one time tasks (sending a message) or periodic tasks. Some jobs, like the connectors, that require executing third party code on the server side, are sandboxed (we use `nsjail` for now).
 - â€¦

The Cozy-Stack also allows to access the database replication API, allowing to sync documents between the server and local databases, for example in mobile clients.

Two authentication methods are available:

 - Web applications running on the server get a session token when the user log in;
 - OAuth2 for other applications.
