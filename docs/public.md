# Public routes

These routes are public: no authentication is required for them.

## Avatar

### GET /public/avatar

Returns an image chosen by the user as their avatar. If no image has been
chosen, a fallback will be used, depending of the `fallback` parameter in the
query-string:

- `default` or no `fallback` parameter: a default image that shows the Cozy
  Cloud logo, but it can be overriden by dynamic assets per context (always a png)
- `404`: just a HTTP 404 - Not found error.
- `anonymous`: a generic user icon without initials visible
- `initials`: a generated image with the initials of
  the owner's public name, with the following special arguments:
    - `format=png`: request a PNG response, otherwise defaults to SVG
    - `fx=translucent`: if SVG, make the output partially transparent
    - `as=unconfirmed`: if SVG, make the output grayscale
    - `q=high`: if SVG, embed the required fonts in the file (otherwise use `<inline>`)
