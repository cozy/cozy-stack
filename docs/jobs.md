# Jobs

Jobs are designed to represent asynchronous tasks that your cozy can execute. These tasks can be scheduled in advance, recurring or sudden and provide various services.

At the time, we do not provide "generic" and programmable tasks. This list of available workers is part of the defined API.

The job queue can be either local to the cozy-stack when used as a monolithic instance (self-hosted for instance) or distributed via a redis server for distributed infrastructures.

This doc introduces two cozy types:

  - `io.cozy.jobs` for jobs
  - `io.cozy.triggers` for triggers


## Triggers

Jobs can be launched by six different types of triggers:

  - `@cron` to schedule recurring jobs scheduled at specific times
  - `@interval` to schedule periodic jobs executed at a given fix interval
  - `@at` to schedule a one-time job executed after at a specific time in the future
  - `@in` to schedule a one-time job executed after a specific amount of time
  - `@event` to launch a job after a change in the cozy
  - `@webhook` to launch a job by requesting an unguessable URL

These six triggers have specific syntaxes to describe when jobs should be scheduled. See below for more informations.

Jobs can also be queued up programatically, without the help of a specific trigger directly via the `/jobs/queue` API. In this case the `trigger` name is empty.

### `@cron` syntax

In order to schedule recurring jobs, the `@cron` trigger has the syntax using six fields:

Field name   | Mandatory? | Allowed values  | Allowed special characters
-------------|------------|-----------------|---------------------------
Seconds      | Yes        | 0-59            | * / , -
Minutes      | Yes        | 0-59            | * / , -
Hours        | Yes        | 0-23            | * / , -
Day of month | Yes        | 1-31            | * / , - ?
Month        | Yes        | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | * / , -
Day of week  | Yes        | 0-6 or SUN-SAT  | * / , - ?

Asterisk ( `*` )

The asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values of
the field; e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would indicate
every month.

Slash ( `/` )

Slashes are used to describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in the
1st field (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every 15
minutes thereafter. The form ``"*\/..."`` is equivalent to the form
``"first-last/..."``, that is, an increment over the largest possible range of
the field. The form `"N-/..."` is accepted as meaning `"N-MAX/..."`, that is,
starting at N, use the increment until the end of that specific range. It does
not wrap around.

Comma ( `,` )

Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using `"MON,WED,FRI"`
in the 5th field (day of week) would mean Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

Hyphen ( `-` )

Hyphens are used to define ranges. For example, 9-17 would indicate every hour
between 9am and 5pm inclusive.

Question mark ( `?` )

Question mark may be used instead of `*` for leaving either day-of-month or
day-of-week blank.

To schedule jobs given an interval:

Examples:

```
@cron 0 0 0 1 1 * # Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st
@cron 0 0 0 1 1 * # Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st
@cron 0 0 0 1 * * # Run once a month, midnight, first of month
@cron 0 0 0 * * 0 # Run once a week, midnight on Sunday
@cron 0 0 0 * * * # Run once a day, midnight
@cron 0 0 * * * * # Run once an hour, beginning of hour
```


### `@interval` syntax

The `@interval` trigger uses the same syntax as golang's `time.ParseDuration` (but only support time units above seconds):

A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with
optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid
time units are "s", "m", "h".

Examples

```
@interval 1.5h   # schedules every 1 and a half hours
@interval 30m10s # schedules every 30 minutes and 10 seconds
```


### `@at` syntax

The `@at` trigger takes a ISO-8601 formatted string indicating a UTC time in the future. The date is of this form: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`

Examples

```
@at 2016-12-12T15:36:25.507Z
```

### `@in` syntax

The `@in` trigger takes the same duration syntax as `@interval`

Examples

```
@in 10m
@in 1h30m
```


### `@event` syntax

The `@event` syntax is not determined yet. Its main purpose will be to describe job scheduling after a filesystem or database modification.


### `@webhook` syntax

The `@webhook` syntax does not take any specific input. It is a specific trigger that generates a unique URL that can used by an external service to push a new job.

For example, we could give a webhook URL to github to update on our cozy the app after each new release.


### Launcher rate limitation

Every trigger has a rate limitation policy to prevent triggers from spawning too many jobs at the same time. The specific rules are not yet decided, but they should work along the two following properties.

#### Parallel limitations

Each trigger will have a limited number of workers it is allowed to queue in parallel.

#### Back pressure

Each trigger should have a back-pressure policy to drop job spawning when not necessary. For instance:

* *throttling policy* (aka *debouncing*) to drop job actions given timings parameters. ie. a job scheduled after contact updates should only be triggered once after several contacts are updated in a given time lapse, or should be scheduled when the updates stopped for a given time
* *side effect limitation* in the case of an `@event` trigger, a job doing an external API call should not be spawned if another one is already running for another close event
* *full queue* when no worker is available, or the queue has too many elements, it can decide to drop the job action (given some informations)


## Error Handling

Jobs can fail to execute their task. We have two ways to parameterize such cases.

### Retry

A retry count can be optionally specified to ask the worker to re-execute the task if it has failed.

Each retry is executed after a configurable delay. The try count is part of the attributes of the job. Also, each occurring error is kept in the `errors` field containing all the errors that may have happened.

### Timeout

A worker may never end. To prevent this, a configurable timeout value is specified with the job.

If a job does not end after the specified amount of time, it will be aborted. A timeout is just like another error from the worker and can provoke a retry if specified.

### Defaults

By default, jobs are parameterized with a maximum of 3 tries with 1 minute timeout.

These defaults may vary given the workload of the workers.


## Jobs API

Example and description of the attributes of a `io.cozy.jobs`:

```js
{
  "worker": "sendmail",    // worker type name
  "trigger": "@cron",      // "@cron", "@interval", "@event" or ""
  "trigger_id": "1234",    // trigger id, if any
  "options": {
    "priority": 3,         // priority from 1 to 100, higher number is higher priority
    "timeout": 60,         // timeout value in seconds
    "max_exec_count": 3,   // maximum number of time the job should be executed (including retries)
  },
  "state": "running",      // queued, running, errored
  "try_count": 1,          // number of time the job has been executed.
                           // increased at the start of new execution
  "queued_at": "2016-09-19T12:35:08Z",  // time of the queuing
  "started_at": "2016-09-19T12:35:08Z", // time of first execution
  "errors": [],            // list of errors
  "output": {}             // output of the worker, if any
}
```

Example and description of a job creation options â€” as you can see, the options are replicated in the `io.cozy.jobs` attributes:

```js
{
  "priority": 3,         // priority from 1 to 100
  "timeout": 60,         // timeout value in seconds
  "max_exec_count": 3,   // maximum number of retry
}
```

## Worker pool

The consuming side of the job queue is handled by a worker pool.

On a monolithic cozy-stack, the worker pool has a configurable fixed size of workers. The default value is not yet determined. Each time a worker has finished a job, it check the queue and based on the priority and the queued date of the job, picks a new job to execute.


## Permissions

In order to prevent jobs from leaking informations between applications, we may need to add filtering per applications: for instance one queue per applications.

We should also have an explicit check on the permissions of the applications before launching a job scheduled by an application. For more information, refer to our [permission document](./permissions).
