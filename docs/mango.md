# Create an index for some documents

The body should contains a `index` JSON field containing a `fields` which is an ordered array of fields to index.

#### Request
```http
POST /data/:doctype/_index
```
```http
POST /data/io.cozy.events/_index
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
  "index": {
    "fields": ["calendar", "date"]
  }
}
```

#### Response OK
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Length: ...
Content-Type: application/json
```

{
    "result": "created",
    "id": "_design/a5f4711fc9448864a13c81dc71e660b524d7410c",

}
```

- if the doctype does not exists, the database is created.
- if the index already exists, a `{result: "exists"}` is returned, but the response code is still 200
- design doc & name can be provided in request. **This is not recommended**, let couchdb handles naming and deduplication.

  "index": { "fields": ... }
}
