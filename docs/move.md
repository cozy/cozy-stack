# Move, export and import

## Export

A Cozy's user can ask at any time to export a snapshot of all its data and
metadata. This export takes place asynchronously and is separated in two parts:
_ a metadata tarball containing the in a JSON format all the doctypes _
multi-part files tarballs containing the files (or a subpart of the files)

The export process is part of a worker described in the
[workers section](./workers.md#export) of the documentation.

Endpoints described in this documentation require a permission on the
`io.cozy.exports` doctype.

### POST /move/exports

This endpoint can be used to create a new export job.

Exports options fields are:

-   `parts_size` (optional) (int): the size in bytes of a tarball files part.
-   `max_age` (optional) (duration / nanosecs): the maximum age of the export
    data.
-   `with_doctypes` (optional) (string array): the list of whitelisted exported
    doctypes
-   `without_files` (optional) (boolean): whether or not the export contains the
    files index (if false, it is not possible to generate files tarball).

#### Request

```http
POST /move/exports HTTP/1.1
Host: alice.cozy.tools
Authorization: Bearer ...
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

            "with_doctypes": [],
            "without_files": false
        }
    }
}
```

### GET /move/exports/:opaque-identifier

This endpoint can be used to fetch the metadata of an export.

Exports fields are:

-   `parts_size` (int): the size in bytes of a tarball files part.
-   `parts_cursors` (string array): the list of cursors to access to the
    different files parts.
-   `parts_length` (int): number of parts
-   `with_doctypes` (string array): the list of whitelisted exported doctypes
    (if empty of null, all doctypes are exported)
-   `without_files` (boolean): whether or not the export contains the files
    index (if false, it is not possible to generate files tarball).
-   `state` (string): the state of the export (`"exporting"` / `"done"` /
    `"error"`).
-   `created_at` (string / time): the date of creation of the export
-   `expires_at` (string / time): the date of expiration of the export
-   `total_size` (int): the total size of the export metadata
-   `creation_duration` (int): the amount of nanoseconds taken for the creation
    of the export
-   `error` (string): an error string if the export is in an `"error"` state

    }

### GET /move/exports/data/:opaque-identifier?cursor=XXX

This endpoint will download an archive containing the metadata and files of the
user, as part of a multi-part download. The cursor given should be one of the
defined in the export document `parts_cursors`.

Only the first part of the data contains the metadata.
