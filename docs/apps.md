# Applications

It's possible to manage serverless applications from the cozy stack and serve
them via cozy stack. The stack does the routing and serve the HTML and the
assets for the applications. The assets of the applications are installed in the
virtual file system.

## Install an application

### The manifest

To install an application, cozy needs a manifest. It's a JSON document that
describes the application (its name and icon for example), how to install it and
what it needs for its usage (the permissions in particular). While we have
considered to use the same
[manifest format as the W3C for PWAs](https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/), it
didn't match our expectations. The
[manifest format for FirefoxOS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_apps/Building_apps_for_Firefox_OS/Manifest)
is a better fit. We took a lot of inspirations from it, starting with the
filename for this file: `manifest.webapp`.

| permissions       | a map of permissions needed by the app (see [here](permissions.md) for more details)     |
| notifications     | a map of notifications needed by the app (see [here](notifications.md) for more details) |
| services          | a map of the services associated with the app (see below for more details)               |
| routes            | a map of routes for the app (see below for more details)                                 |

### Routes

A route make the mapping between the requested paths and the files. It can have
an index, which is an HTML file, with a token injected on it that identify both
the application. This token must be used with the user cookies to use the
services of the cozy-stack.

By default, a route can be only visited by the authenticated owner of the
instance where the app is installed. But a route can be marked as public. In
that case, anybody can visit the route.

For example, an application can offer an administration interface on `/admin`, a
public page on `/public`, and shared assets in `/assets`:

```json
{
    "/admin": {
        "folder": "/",
        "index": "admin.html",
        "public": false
    },
    "/public": {
        "folder": "/public",
        "index": "index.html",
        "public": true
    },
    "/assets": {
        "folder": "/assets",
        "public": true
    }
}
```

If an application has no routes in its manifest, the stack will create one
route, this default one:

```json
{
    "/": {
        "folder": "/",
        "index": "index.html",
        "public": false
    }
}
```

**Note**: if you have a public route, it's probably better to put the app icon
in it. So, the cozy-bar can display it for the users that go on the public part
of the app.

### Services

Application may require background and offline process to analyse the user's
data and emit some notification or warning even without the user being on the
application. These part of the application are called services and can be
declared as part of the application in its manifest.

In contrast to [konnectors](./konnectors.md), services have the same permissions
as the web application and are not intended to collect outside informations but
rather analyse the current set of collected information inside the cozy. However
they share the same mechanisms as the konnectors to describe how and when they
should be executed: via our trigger system.

To define a service, first the code needs to be stored with the application
content, as single (packaged) javascript files. In the manifest, declare the
service and its parameters following this example:

```json
{
    "services": {
        "low-budget-notification": {
            "type": "node",
            "file": "/services/low-budget-notification.js",
            "trigger": "@cron 0 0 0 * * *"
        }
        // ...
    }
}
```

The `trigger` field should follow the available triggers described in the
[jobs documentation](./jobs.md). The `file` field should specify the service
code run and the `type` field describe the code type (only `"node"` for now).

### Available fields to the service
During the service execution, the stack will give some environment variables to the service if you need to use them.

```bash
- "COZY_URL" # Cozy URL
- "COZY_CREDENTIALS" # The cozy app related token
- "COZY_LANGUAGE" # Lang used for the service (ex: node)
- "COZY_LOCALE" # Locale of the Cozy
- "COZY_TIME_LIMIT" # Maximum execution time. After this, the job will be killed
- "COZY_JOB_ID" # Job ID
- "COZY_COUCH_DOC" # The CouchDB document which triggers the service
```
### Notifications

For more informations on how te declare notifications in the manifest, see the
[notifications documentation](./notifications.md).

Here is an example:

```json
{
    "notifications": {
        "account-balance": {
            "description": "Alert the user when its account balance is negative",
            "collapsible": true, // only interested in the last value of the notification
            "multiple": true, // require sub-categories for each account
            "stateful": false,
            "default_priority": "high", // high priority for this notification
            "templates": {
                "mail": "file:./notifications/account-balance-mail.tpl"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Resource caching

To help caching of applications assets, we detect the presence of a unique
identifier in the name of assets: a unique identifier is matched when the file
base name contains a long hexadecimal subpart between '.', of at least 10
characters. For instance `app.badf00dbadf00d.js` or `icon.badbeefbadbeef.1.png`.

With such a unique identifier, the asset is considered immutable, and a long
cache-control is added on corresponding HTTP responses.

We recommend the use of bundling tools like
[webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) which offer the possibility to add such
identifier on the building step of the application packages for all assets.

## Sources

Here is the available sources, defined by the scheme of the source URL:

-   `registry://`: to install an application from the instance registries
-   `git://` or `git+ssh://`: to install an application from a git repository
-   `http://` or `https://`: to install an application from an http server (via
    a tarball)
-   `file://`: to install an application from a local directory (for instance:
    `file:///home/user/code/cozy-app`)

The `registry` scheme expect the following elements:

-   scheme: `registry`
-   host: the name of the application
-   path: `/:channel` the channel of the application (see the
    [registry](./registry.md) doc)

Examples: `registry://drive/stable`, `registry://drive/beta`, and
`registry://drive/dev`.

For the `git` scheme, the fragment in the URL can be used to specify which
branch to install.

For the `http` and `https` schemes, the fragment can be used to give the
expected sha256sum.

### POST /apps/:slug

Install an application, ie download the files and put them in `/apps/:slug` in
the virtual file system of the user, create an `io.cozy.apps` document, register
the permissions, etc.

This endpoint is asynchronous and returns a successful return as soon as the
application installation has started, meaning we have successfully reached the
manifest and started to fetch application data.

To make this endpoint synchronous, use the header `Accept: text/event-stream`.
This will make a eventsource stream sending the manifest and returning when the
application has been installed or failed.

#### Status codes

-   202 Accepted, when the application installation has been accepted.
-   400 Bad-Request, when the manifest of the application could not be processed
    (for instance, it is not valid JSON).
-   404 Not Found, when the manifest or the source of the application is not
    reachable.
-   422 Unprocessable Entity, when the sent data is invalid (for example, the
    slug is invalid or the Source parameter is not a proper or supported url)

#### Query-String

| Parameter | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source    | URL from where the app can be downloaded (only for install) |

The Source parameter is optional: by default, the stable channel of the
registry will be used.

#### Request

```http
POST /apps/emails?Source=git://github.com/cozy/cozy-emails.git HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
```

```json
{
  "data": [{
    "id": "4cfbd8be-8968-11e6-9708-ef55b7c20863",
    "type": "io.cozy.apps",
    "meta": {

      ...
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "/apps/calendar"
    }
  }]
}
```

**Note**: it's possible to choose a git branch by passing it in the fragment
like this:

```http
POST /apps/emails-dev?Source=git://github.com/cozy/cozy-emails.git%23dev HTTP/1.1
```

### PUT /apps/:slug

Update an application with the specified slug name.

This endpoint is asynchronous and returns a successful return as soon as the
application installation has started, meaning we have successfully reached the
manifest and started to fetch application data.

To make this endpoint synchronous, use the header `Accept: text/event-stream`.
This will make a eventsource stream sending the manifest and returning when the
application has been updated or failed.

#### Request

```http
PUT /apps/emails HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
```

```json
{
  "data": [{
    "id": "4cfbd8be-8968-11e6-9708-ef55b7c20863",
    "type": "io.cozy.apps",
    "meta": {
      "rev": "1-7a1f918147df94580c92b47275e4604a"
    },
    "attributes": {
      "name": "calendar",
      "state": "installing",
      "slug": "calendar",
      ...
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "/apps/calendar"
    }
  }]
}
```

#### Status codes

-   202 Accepted, when the application installation has been accepted.
-   400 Bad-Request, when the manifest of the application could not be processed
    (for instance, it is not valid JSON).
-   404 Not Found, when the application with the specified slug was not found or
    when the manifest or the source of the application is not reachable.
-   422 Unprocessable Entity, when the sent data is invalid (for example, the
    slug is invalid or the Source parameter is not a proper or supported url)

#### Advanced usage

Two optional query parameters are available for an app update:
-   `PermissionsAcked`: (defaults to `true`)
      - Tells that the user accepted the permissions/ToS. It is useful if there are
    newer permissions or Terms Of Service and you want to be sure they were read
    or accepted. If set to `false`, the update will be blocked and the user will
    be told that a new app version is available.\
        > Note: `PermissionsAcked` can be skipped. \
        If an instance is in a `context` configured with the parameter
        `permissions_skip_verification` sets to `true`, permissions
        verification will be ignored.

-   `Source` (defaults to `SourceURL` installation parameter):
      - Use a different source to update this app (e.g. to install a `beta` or `dev`
    app version)

##### Examples:

- You have an email application on a `stable` channel, and you want to update it
  to a particular `beta` version:

```http
PUT /apps/emails?Source=https://<apps-repository>/emails/1.0.0-beta HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
```

- You want to attempt the email app update, but prevent it if new permissions
  were added

```http
PUT /apps/emails?PermissionsAcked=false HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
```

You can combine these parameters to use a precise app version and stay on
another channel (when permissions are different):

  - Install a version (e.g. `1.0.0`)
  - Ask an update to `stable` channel with `PermissionsAcked` to `false`
  - `Source` will be `stable`, and your version remains `1.0.0`

## List installed applications

### GET /apps/

An application can be in one of these states:

-   `installed`, the application is installed but still require some user
    interaction to accept its permissions
-   `ready`, the user can use it
-   `installing`, the installation is running and the app will soon be usable
-   `upgrading`, a new version is being installed
-   `errored`, the app is in an error state and can not be used.

#### Request

```http
GET /apps/ HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

This endpoint is paginated, default limit is currently `100`.
Two flags are available to retreieve the other apps if there are more than `100`
apps installed:
- `limit`
- `start_key`: The first following doc ID of the next apps

The `links` object contains a `ǹext` generated-link for the next docs.

## Uninstall an application

### DELETE /apps/:slug

#### Request

```http
DELETE /apps/tasky HTTP/1.1
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

## Access an application

Each application will run on its sub-domain. The sub-domain is the slug used
when installing the application (`calendar.cozy.example.org` if it was installed
via a POST on /apps/calendar). On the main domain (`cozy.example.org`), there
will be the registration process, the login form, and it will redirect to
`home.cozy.example.org` for logged-in users.

### Rationale

The applications have different roles and permissions. An application is
identified when talking to the stack via a token. The token has to be injected
in the application, one way or another, and it have to be unaccessible from
other apps.

If the applications run on the same domain (for example
`https://cozy.example.org/apps/calendar`), it's nearly impossible to protect an
application to take the token of another application. The security model of the
web is based too heavily on
[Same Origin Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)
for that. If the token is put in the html of the index.html page of an app,
another app can use the fetch API to get the html page, parse its content and
extract the token. We can think of other ways to inject the token (indexeddb,
URL, cookies) but none will provide a better isolation. Maybe in a couple years,
when [the origin spec](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-suborigins/) will be more
advanced.

So, if having the apps on the same origin is not possible, we have to put them
on several origins. One interesting way to do that is using sandboxed iframes.
An iframe with
[the sandbox attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#attr-iframe-sandbox),
and not `allow-same-origin` in it, will be assigned to a unique origin. The W3C
warns:

> Potentially hostile files should not be served from the same server as the
> file containing the iframe element. Sandboxing hostile content is of minimal
> help if an attacker can convince the user to just visit the hostile content
> directly, rather than in the iframe. To limit the damage that can be caused by
> hostile HTML content, it should be served from a separate dedicated domain.
> Using a different domain ensures that scripts in the files are unable to
> attack the site, even if the user is tricked into visiting those pages
> directly, without the protection of the sandbox attribute.

It may be possible to disable all html pages to have an html content-type,
except the home, and having the home loading the apps in a sandboxed iframe, via
the `srcdoc` attribute. But, it will mean that we will have to reinvent nearly
everything. Even showing an image can no longer be done via an `<img>` tag, it
will need to use post-message with the home. Such a solution is difficult to
implement, is a very fragile (both for the apps developer than for security) and
is an hell to debug when it breaks. Clearly, it's not an acceptable solution.

Thus, the only choice is to have several origins, and sub-domains is the best
way for that. Of course, it has the downside to be more complicated to deploy
(DNS and TLS certificates). But, in the tradeoff between security and ease of
administration, we definetively take the security first.

### Routes

> Should we be concerned that all the routes are on the same sub-domain?

No, it's not an issue. There are two types of routes: the ones that are publics
and those reserved to the authenticated user. Public routes have no token

Private routes are private, they can be accessed only with a valid session
cookie, ie by the owner of the instance. Another application can't use the user
cookies to read the token, because of the restrictions of the same origin policy
(they are on different domains). And the application can't use an open proxy to
read the private route, because it doesn't have the user cookies for that (the
cookie is marked as `httpOnly`).
