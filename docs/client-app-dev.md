# Develop a client-side application

## Using `cozy-app-dev`

This document describe a tool to run an environment in order to develop
client-side application on the cozy-stack.

We provide two different ways to run this environment, either manually where you
have to install part of the dependencies yourself or _via_ a Docker image in
which all dependencies are packed.

This environment will provide a running instance a http server serving both a
specified directory of your application on `app.cozy.tools:8080` and the
`cozy-stack` on `cozy.tools:8080` (you can change the hostname and port if you
want, see below).

The default passphrase will be "cozy"

### Manually

To run the `scripts/cozy-app-dev.sh` directly on you system, you'll need to
following dependencies:

-   `go`
-   `curl`
-   `git`
-   `couchdb2`: you need at least a running instance of CouchDB 2

Examples:

```sh
$ ./scripts/cozy-app-dev.sh -d ~/code/myapp
```

If your CouchDB 2 instance is not running on `localhost:5984`, you can specify
another host and port with the variable `COUCHDB_URL` like so:

```sh
$ COUCHDB_URL=http://couchdb.local:1234/ ./scripts/cozy-app-dev.sh -d ~/code/myapp
```

You can have more informations about the usage of this script with the following
command:

```
$ ./scripts/cozy-app-dev.sh -h
```

### With Docker

If you do not want to install the required dependencies, we provide a Docker
image which encapsulates the dev script and all its dependencies.

To download the latest version, you can run this command:

```sh
docker pull cozy/cozy-app-dev
```

If you work behind a corporate proxy, and Docker is configured to inject proxy
configuration into the containers, you need to ensure that both `localhost` and
`cozy.tools` are configured not to use the proxy. Following is the minimal
`~/.docker/config.json` configuration that has been shown to work:

```json
{
    "proxies": {
        "default": {
            "httpProxy": "MY_CORPORATE_PROXY",
            "httpsProxy": "MY_CORPORATE_PROXY",
            "noProxy": "localhost,cozy.tools"
        }
    }
}
```

To run a ephemeral instance, on the `$HOME/myapp` directory, use the following
command (warning: all the data stored by your application in couchdb and the VFS
won't remain after):

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -p 8025:8025 \
    -v "$HOME/myapp":/data/cozy-app \
    cozy/cozy-app-dev
```

To keep your data even when stopping the container, run the following command:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -p 8025:8025 \
    -v "$HOME/myapp":/data/cozy-app \
    -v "$(pwd)/db":/usr/local/couchdb/data \
    -v "$(pwd)/storage":/data/cozy-storage \
    cozy/cozy-app-dev
```

You can mount your yaml config file, to change the log level for example:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -p 8025:8025 \
    -v "$HOME/myapp":/data/cozy-app \
    -v "$HOME/cozy.yaml":/etc/cozy/cozy.yaml \
    cozy/cozy-app-dev
```

A [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) is running inside docker to
catch emails. You can view the emails sent by the stack in a web interface on
http://cozy.tools:8025/

You can also expose the couchdb port (listening in the container on 5984) in
order to access its admin page. For instance add `-p 1234:5984` to access to the
admin interface on `http://localhost:1234/_utils`.

Make sure you application is built into `$HOME/myapp` (it should have an
`index.html` and a `manifest.webapp` files), otherwise it will not work. As an
example, for the [Drive application](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-drive/), it
should be `$HOME/drive/build`.

If you want to use several applications (for testing the intents for example),
you can mount several directories inside `/data/cozy-app` like this:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -p 8025:8025 \
    -v "$HOME/appone":/data/cozy-app/appone \
    -v "$HOME/apptwo":/data/cozy-app/apptwo \
    cozy/cozy-app-dev
```

## Good practices for your application

When an application makes a request to the stack, like loading a list of
contacts, it sends two informations that will be used by the stack to allow or
deny the access:

-   the user session cookie
-   a token that identifies the application (only when the user is connected).

So, the application needs such a token. It also needs to know where to send the
requests for the stack (it can be guessed, but with the nested vs flat
subdomains structures, it's better to get the information from the stack). To do
that, when the application loads its HTML index file, the stack will parse it as
a template and will insert the relevant values.

-   `{{.Token}}` will be replaced by the token for the application.
-   `{{.Domain}}` will be replaced by the stack hostname.
-   `{{.Locale}}` will be replaced by the locale for the instance.
-   `{{.AppName}}`: will be replaced by the application name.
-   `{{.AppSlug}}`: will be replaced by the application slug.
-   `{{.AppNamePrefix}}`: will be replaced by the application name prefix.
-   `{{.AppEditor}}`: will be replaced by the application's editor.
-   `{{.IconPath}}`: will be replaced by the application's icon path.
-   `{{.CozyBar}}` will be replaced by the JavaScript to inject the cozy-bar.
-   `{{.CozyClientJS}}` will be replaced by the JavaScript to inject the
    cozy-client-js.
-   `{{.ThemeCSS}}` will be replaced by the `theme.css`. It is empty by default,
    but can be overrided by using `contexts`. See
    [contexts](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/assets/#contexts) and [dynamic
    assets](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/cli/cozy-stack_config_insert-asset/)
    for more informations.
-   `{{.Favicon}}` will be replaced by the favicon served by the stack.
-   `{{.SubDomain}}` will be replaced by `flat` or `nested`.

So, the `index.html` should probably looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{.Locale}}">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My Awesome App for Cozy</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff">
    <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" crossOrigin="use-credentials">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="my-app.css">
    {{.ThemeCSS}}
    {{.CozyClientJS}}
    {{.CozyBar}}
  </head>
  <body>
    <div
      role="application"
      data-cozy-token="{{.Token}}"
      data-cozy-domain="{{.Domain}}"
      data-cozy-locale="{{.Locale}}"
      data-cozy-app-editor="{{.AppEditor}}"
      data-cozy-app-name="{{.AppName}}"
      data-cozy-app-slug="{{.AppSlug}}"
      data-cozy-icon-path="{{.IconPath}}"
      >
    </div>
    <script src="my-app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

And `my-app.js`:

```js
"use strict";

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const app = document.querySelector("[role=application]");
  const data = app.dataset;

  cozy.client.init({
      cozyURL: "//" + data.cozyStack,
      token: data.cozyToken
  });

  cozy.bar.init({
    appEditor: data.cozyAppEditor,
    appName: data.cozyAppName,
    iconPath: data.cozyIconPath,
    lang: data.cozyLocale
  });

  // ...
});
```
