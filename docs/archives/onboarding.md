# Onboarding

This document explains the architecture and process allowing a cozy instance
owner to register to its cozy instance.

Compatibility with the current developments on cozy onboarding is a goal :
[The following documents has been consulted for this proposal](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-proxy/blob/bf9af7f2342e3fc183a8b4e72bcedb909afa3eb8/docs/client/)

## Instance creation

Creating an instance is done through CLI or through the (future) partner farm
manager system. Some **settings** can be pre-defined on instance creation.
([doc](instance.md#creation)).

The CLI also allows to specify which source to use for `onboarding` and `home`
applications. The defaults will be hosted on `github.com/cozy`.

After creation, an instance has a `registerToken` generated randomly.

## Onboarding steps

This document and the cozy-stack are only concerned with login and passphrase
registering step which are important for security.

All other steps are handled by the `onboarding` application.

The `onboarding` application SHOULD therefore provide the following features

-   When started with a `registerToken`, allow the user to create a passphrase
-   When started with a `contextToken`
    ([see auth doc](auth.md#how-to-get-a-token)) use it to retrieve instance
    document.
    -   If the instance document is complete **according to the `onboarding`
        app**, redirect to `home` application.
    -   Otherwise, performs whatever steps it deems necessary to fill out the
        instance (ask for user email, help set up `myaccounts` accounts, say
        thank you...)

This makes cozy-stack simple and safer while allowing behaviour modification for
several install types by picking the correct `onboarding` application / branch.

This makes it easier to add more onboarding steps and have them run on
already-installed cozy: On next login after onboarding application update, it
will ask the user.

## Redirections

When an user attempts to access the root of its instance
(`https://example.cozycloud.cc`) or an application
(`https://contacts.example.cozycloud.cc`), and she is not logged-in, she is
redirected :

-   If the instance has a `passphrase` set, to the `/login` page
-   If the instance has a `registerToken` set, to the `onboarding` application.

After login, the user is always redirected to the `onboarding` application. It
is the `onboarding` application responsibility to check if registering is
complete and reredirect to home.

## Routes

See [settings](settings.md).

## Flow Example

-   The server administrator Bob creates an instance through the CLI. He knows
    the instance should be in french for an user named `alice`.

```
cozy-stack instances add alice.example.com --locale fr
>> https://alice.cozycloud.cc?registerToken=42456565213125454842
```

The instance is created

```json
{
    "domain": "alice.example.com",
    "locale": "fr"
}
```

-   Eve knows Alice just had an instance created, she goes to
    `https://alice.cozycloud.cc`. There is no `registerToken`, so she only see a
    message (in french) along the lines of "This is the cozy for Alice Martin,
    this register link is incorrect, if you are Alice Martin please ask your
    sysadmin for a new link".
-   Alice navigates to `https://alice.cozycloud.cc?registerToken=42...42`
-   She is redirected to the `onboarding` application
-   The `onboarding` application receive the registerToken. It is the default
    onboarding application and therefore display the cozy cloud agreement and
    then ask for a Password.
-   The `onboarding` application use its `registerToken` to register the
    passphrase. Registering the passphrase automatically log Alice in and
    redirect her back to the `onboarding` app.
-   Afterward, the `onboarding` app receive its token normally through the
    `data-cozy-token` body attribute, as described in
    [auth documentation](./auth.md). and can do whatever it needs to do :
    -   read from the instance document to prefill/bypass form fields
    -   add more informations to the instance document.
    -   create `io.cozy.accounts` documents for external accounts.
-   When the onboarding application is satisfied, Alice is redirected to the
    `home` application
