## What is the Cozy-Stack?

The cozy-stack is the main backend server for the Cozy platform.

[Full Cozy-Stack documentation here](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/).

The Cozy-Stack is in charge of serving / running the applications users have installed on their Cozy.

It is in charge of:

 - creating, updating, deleting documents inside the database;
 - authenticating users and client applications;
 - sending emails;
 - launching jobs on the server. Connectors that import data from remote websites are jobs. Jobs can be one time tasks (sending a message) or periodic tasks. Jobs that require executing third party code on the server side (like connectors), are sandboxed;
 - database replication API, allowing to sync documents between the server and local databases, for example in mobile clients.

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/issues/new) for questions and suggestions.
