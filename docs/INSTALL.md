# How to install Cozy-stack?

## Dependencies

-   A reverse-proxy (nginx, caddy, haproxy, etc.)
-   A SMTP server
-   CouchDB 2
-   Git
-   Image Magick

To install CouchDB 2 through Docker, take a look at our
[Docker specific documentation](docker.md).

**Note:** to generate thumbnails for heic/heif images, the version 7.0.7-22+ of
Image Magick is required.

## Install for self-hosting

We have started to write documentation on how to install cozy on your own
server. We have [a guide for
debian](https://docs.cozy.io/en/tutorials/selfhost-debian/). Don't hesitate to
report issues with it. It will help us improve it.

## Install for development / local tests

### Install the binary

You can either download the binary or compile it.

#### Download an official release

You can download a `cozy-stack` binary from our official releases:
https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/releases. It is a just a single executable
file (choose the one for your platform). Rename it to cozy-stack, give it the
executable bit (`chmod +x cozy-stack`) and put it in your `$PATH`.
`cozy-stack version` should show you the version if every thing is right.

#### Using `go`

[Install go](https://golang.org/doc/install), version >= 1.11. With `go`
installed and configured, you can run the following command:

```
go get -u github.com/cozy/cozy-stack
```

This will fetch the sources in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/cozy/cozy-stack` and
build a binary in `$GOPATH/bin/cozy-stack`.

Don't forget to add your `$GOPATH` to your `$PATH` in your `*rc` file so that
you can execute the binary without entering its full path.

```
export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"
```

### Add an instance for testing

You can configure your `cozy-stack` using a configuration file or different
comand line arguments. Assuming CouchDB is installed and running on default port
`5984`, you can start the server:

```bash
cozy-stack serve
```

And then create an instance for development:

```bash
cozy-stack instances add --apps home,drive,settings,store --passphrase cozy "cozy.tools:8080"
```

The cozy-stack server listens on http://cozy.tools:8080/ by default. See
`cozy-stack --help` for more informations.

The above command will create an instance on http://cozy.tools:8080/ with the
passphrase `cozy`.

Make sure the full stack is up with:

```bash
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' 'http://cozy.tools:8080/status/'
```

You can then remove your test instance:

```bash
cozy-stack instances rm cozy.tools:8080
```
