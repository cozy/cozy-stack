# Admin

## Introduction

An admin API is available on the stack. It offers several endpoints to interact
with your cozy-stack installation (E.g. interacting with instances, generating tokens, ...).

:warning: Use the admin API only if you know what you are doing. The admin API
provides a basic authentication, you **must** protect these endpoints as they
are very powerful.

The default port for the admin endpoints is `6060`. If you want to customize the parameters, please see the [config file documentation page](config.md).


## Instance

### GET /instances

Returns the list of all instances. By default, there is no pagination, but it
is possible to add a `page[limit]` parameter in the query-string to paginate (
cf [JSON-API pagination](./http-api.md#pagination)). A `page[skip]` parameter in
the query-string is also supported, but CouchDB may be slow on requests with a
skip on large collections.

#### Request

```http
GET /instances HTTP/1.1
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
```

Returns the count of all instances.

#### Request

```http
GET /instances/count HTTP/1.1
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```

```

### GET /instances/:domain/last-activity

It returns an approximate date of when the instance was last used by their
owner (automatic jobs like connectors don't count). It looks at the sessions
and OAuth tokens.

### PATCH /instances/:domain

This route can be used to change an instance (email, locale, disk quota, ToS,
etc.)

**Note** a special parameter `FromCloudery=true` in the query string can be
used to tell the stack to not call the cloudery if the email or public name has
changed, since the change is already coming from the cloudery.

#### Request

```http
PATCH /instances/john.mycozy.cloud?Email=john@example.com&FromCloudery=true HTTP/1.1
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

#### Query-String

| Parameter | Description                                                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| admin-req | Boolean indicating when the request is made by an admin and the user should not be notified |

The admin-req parameter is optional: by default, the instance's owner will be 
notified via e-mail, whether the export is successful or not. If it's 
successful, the e-mail will contain a link to the Settings app allowing the user
to download the data archives.
When this parameter is `true`, no e-mails will be sent and the admin will be 
able to get the export document via realtime events.

### POST /instances/:domain/notifications

This endpoint allows to send a notification via the notification center. Both
the notification declaration and its properties need to be passed in the body.
These notifications cannot use templates defined in cozy-stack though so their
e-mail content must be provided directly (at least in HTML).

When the request is successful, the generated notification object is returned.

```http
POST /instances/alice.cozy.localhost/notifications HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer ...
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Checkers

### GET /instances/:domain/fsck

This endpoint can be use to check the VFS of a given instance. It accepts three
possible parameters in the query-string:

- `IndexIntegrity=true` to check only the integrity of the data in CouchDB
- `FilesConsistency` to check the consistency between CouchDB and Swift
- `FailFast` to abort on the first error.

It will returns a `200 OK`, except if the instance is not found where the code
will be `404 Not Found` (a `5xx` can also happen in case of server errors like
CouchDB not available). The format of the response will be one JSON per line,
and each JSON represents an error.

#### Request

```http
GET /instances/alice.cozy.localhost/fsck HTTP/1.1
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

### POST /instances/:domain/checks/sharings

This endpoint can be used to check the setup of sharings owned by a given
instance and the consistency of the shared files and folders with their
counterparts on the Cozy they're shared with. It accepts one parameter in the
query-string:

- `Fast` to skip the files and folders consistency check as it can be quite long

It will return a `200 OK`, except if the instance is not found where the code
will be `404 Not Found` (a `5xx` can also happen in case of server errors like
CouchDB not available). The format of the response will be a JSON array of
objects, each object representing an error.


#### Possible error types

##### invalid_rules

This will be raised when the owner's sharing rules are invalid.
The validation result will be returned in the `error` attribute.

##### sharing_in_sharing

This will be raised when the root of the sharing being checked is part of
another sharing (i.e. one of its parent folders is shared). The parent
sharing can be found either on the owner's instance or on one of its members'
instance.
The `parent_sharing` attribute will contain the parent sharing ID.

##### missing_matching_docs_for_owner

This will be raised if the shared files and folders associated with the sharing
could not be fetched on the owner's instance.
The request error will be returned in the `error` attribute.
No further consistency checks will be run on this sharing.

##### missing_sharing_for_member

This will be raised when the associated `io.cozy.sharing` document cannot be
found on a sharing member's instance.
The request error will be returned in the `error` attribute.
No further consistency checks will be run for this member.

##### missing_files_rule_for_member

This will be raised if a member's sharing doesn't have any sharing rule for
`io.cozy.files` documents (while the owner's sharing has been determined to be
of this type).
The member's domain will be available in the `member` attribute.
No further consistency checks will be run for this member.

##### missing_matching_docs_for_member

This will be raised if the shared files and folders associated with the sharing
could not be fetched on a member's instance.
The request error will be returned in the `error` attribute and the member's
domain in the `member` attribute. No further consistency checks will be run for
this member.

##### disk_quota_exceeded

This will be raised if a file is outdated or missing on an instance and its size
is larger than the available space on this instance. If the file was created or
modified in the last 5 minutes, the check is skipped as we expect the
synchronization to happen later.
The instance's domain will be available in the `instance` attribute.

##### read_only_member

This will be raised if a file or folder is outdated or missing on the owner's
instance and the member being checked has only read-only access to the sharing.
This is not really an error as this behavior is expected but since it can be
confusing for users we log it for debugging purposes.
The member's domain will be available in the `member` attribute.

##### invalid_doc_rev

This will be raised if a file or folder's revisions don't match on the owner's
and member's instances while the member has write access to the sharing and the
file size is not greater than the outdated instance's available disk space. The
revisions generations can be the same too. If the document was modified in the
last 5 minutes, the check is skipped as we expect the synchronization to happen
later.
The member's domain will be available in the `member` attribute, as well as the
revision of the member document in `memberRev` and the complete owner document
in `ownerDoc`.

##### invalid_doc_name

This will be raised if a file or folder's revisions match on the owner's and
member's instances but their names don't.
The member's domain will be available in the `member` attribute, as well as the
name of the member document in `memberName` and the complete owner document
in `ownerDoc`.

##### invalid_doc_checksum

This will be raised if a file's revisions match on the owner's and member's
instances but their checksums don't.
The member's domain will be available in the `member` attribute, as well as the
checksum of the member file in `memberChecksum` and the complete owner document
in `ownerDoc`.

##### invalid_doc_parent

This will be raised if a file or folder's parent directories don't match on the
owner's and member's instances but their names don't. Since it is expected for
the sharing root to not have different parents on each instance, the check does
not apply to this document.
The member's domain will be available in the `member` attribute, as well as the
id of the member's parent directory in `memberParent` and the complete owner
document in `ownerDoc`.

##### missing_matching_doc_for_owner

This will be raised if a file or directory is missing on the owner's instance
while the member being check has write access to the sharing and the file size
is not greater than the instance's available disk space. If the missing document
was created or modified in the last 5 minutes, the check is skipped as we expect
the synchronization to happen later.
The member's domain will be available in the `member` attribute and the complete
missing member document in `memberDoc`.

##### missing_matching_doc_for_member

This will be raised if a file or directory is missing on a member's instance
while the file size is not greater than the instance's available disk space. If
the missing document was created or modified in the last 5 minutes, the check is
skipped as we expect the synchronization to happen later.
The member's domain will be available in the `member` attribute and the complete
missing owner document in `ownerDoc`.

===

Other error types include `missing_trigger_on_active_sharing`,
`trigger_on_inactive_sharing`, `not_enough_members`, `mail_not_sent`,
`invalid_member_status`, `invalid_instance_for_member`,
`missing_instance_for_member`, `missing_oauth_client`, `missing_access_token`,
`invalid_number_of_credentials` and `missing_inbound_client_id`.

When checking for files and folders inconsistencies, sharings will be skipped
when inactive, not initialized, read-only or not about `io.cozy.files`
documents.
Also, for each instance, only the sharings owned by said instance will be
checked. Other sharings will be checked via their owner instance.
