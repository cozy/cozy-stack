# Data System

## Typing

The notion of document type does not exist in Couchdb.

Cozy-stack introduce this notion through a special `_type` field.

This type name cannot contain `/`, and it should be unique among all developers,
it is recommended to use the Java naming convention with a domain you own.

All CozyCloud types will be prefixed by io.cozy and be pluralized. Example:
`/data/io.cozy.events/6494e0ac-dfcb-11e5-88c1-472e84a9cbee` Where, `io.cozy.` is
the developer specific prefix, `events` the actual type, and
`6494e0ac-dfcb-11e5-88c1-472e84a9cbee` the document's unique id .

### Details

When some keys don't match an existing document, the response still has a status
200 and the errors are included in the `rows` field (see above, same behavior as
[CouchDB](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/bulk-api.html#post--db-_all_docs)).

```

### Possible errors

-   400 bad request
-   401 unauthorized (no authentication has been provided)
-   403 forbidden (the authentication does not provide permissions for this
    action)

    -   reason: missing
    -   reason: deleted
-   409 Conflict (see Conflict prevention section below)
-   500 internal server error

### Conflict prevention

The client MUST give a `_rev` field in the document. If this field is different
from the one in the current version of the document, an error 409 Conflict will
be returned.

### Details

-   If no id is provided in URL, an error 400 is returned
-   If the id provided in URL is not the same than the one in document, an error
    400 is returned.

### Possible errors

-   400 bad request
-   401 unauthorized (no authentication has been provided)

-   500 internal server error

### Details

-   No id should be provide in the document itself

## Delete a document

### Request

```http
DELETE /data/:type/:id?rev=:rev HTTP/1.1
```

```http
DELETE /data/io.cozy.events/6494e0ac-dfcb-11e5-88c1-472e84a9cbee?rev=1-82a7144c9ec228c9a851b8a1c1aa225b HTTP/1.1

    "ok": true,
    "rev": "2-056f5f44046ecafc08a2bc2b9c229e20",

-   404 not_found
    -   reason: missing
    -   reason: deleted
-   409 Conflict (see Conflict prevention section below)
-   500 internal server error

### Conflict prevention

It is possible to use either a `rev` query string parameter or a HTTP `If-Match`
header to prevent conflict on deletion:

-   If none is passed or they are different, an error 400 is returned
-   If only one is passed or they are equals, the document will only be deleted
    if its `_rev` match the passed one. Otherwise, an error 409 is returned.

### Details

-   If no id is provided in URL, an error 400 is returned

## List all the documents

### Request

Accept: application/json
```

### Response

                "field": "other-value"
            }
        }
    ],
    "total_rows": 2
}
```

### Details

See
[`_all_docs` in couchdb docs](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/bulk-api.html#db-all-docs)

## List all the documents (alternative)

The `_all_docs` endpoint sends the design docs in the response. It makes it hard
to use pagination on it. We have added a non-standard `_normal_docs` endpoint.
This new endpoint skip the design docs (and does not count them in the
`total_rows`). It only accepts two parameters in the query string: `skip`
(default: 0) and `limit` (default: 100).

Note that the response format is a bit different, it looks more like a `_find`
response with mango. And, like for `_find`, the limit cannot be more than 100.

### Request

```http
GET /data/io.cozy.events/_normal_docs?skip=200&limit=100 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
```

### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
    "rows": [
        {
            "_id": "16e458537602f5ef2a710089dffd9453",
            "_rev": "1-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d",
            "field": "value"
        },
        {
            "_id": "f4ca7773ddea715afebc4b4b15d4f0b3",
            "_rev": "2-7051cbe5c8faecd085a3fa619e6e6337",
            "field": "other-value"
        }
    ],
    "total_rows": 202
}
```

## List the known doctypes

A permission on `io.cozy.doctypes` for `GET` is needed to query this endoint.

### Request

```http
GET /data/_all_doctypes HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
```

### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
["io.cozy.files", "io.cozy.jobs", "io.cozy.triggers", "io.cozy.settings"]
```

## Others

-   The creation and usage of [Mango indexes](mango.md) is possible.
-   CouchDB behaviors are not always straight forward: see
