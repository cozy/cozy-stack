# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the cozy-stack project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Template

Each ADR should include:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The situation and problem we are facing
- **Proposal**: The proposed solution
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered
- **Decision**: The final decision and rationale
- **Consequences**: The resulting effects (positive and negative)
