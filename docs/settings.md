## Disk usage

### GET /settings/disk-usage

Says how many bytes are available and used to store files. When not limited the
`quota` field is omitted.
Also says how many bytes are used by last version of files and how many bytes are taken by older versions.

#### Request

```http
GET /settings/disk-usage HTTP/1.1
Host: alice.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
Authorization: Bearer ...
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/vnd.api+json
```

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "io.cozy.settings",
        "id": "io.cozy.settings.disk-usage",
        "attributes": {
            "is_limited": true,
            "quota": "123456789",
            "used": "12345678",
            "files": "10305070",
            "versions": "2040608"
        }
    }
}
```

## Passphrase

The master password, known by the cozy owner, is used for two things: to allow
the user to login and to do encryption on the client side. To do so, two keys
are derivated from the master password, one for each usage. In this section, we
are talking about the derivated key used for login on a cozy instance.

### GET /settings/passphrase

The server will send the parameters for hashing the master password on the
client side to derive a key used for login.

Note: a permission on `GET io.cozy.settings` is required for this endpoint.

#### Request

```http
GET /settings/passphrase HTTP/1.1
Host: alice.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
Authorization: Bearer ...
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/vnd.api+json
```

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "io.cozy.settings",
        "id": "io.cozy.settings.passphrase",
        "attributes": {
            "salt": "me@alice.example.com",
            "kdf": 0,
            "iterations": 10000
        }
    }
}
```

Note: only `kdf: 0` is currently supported. It means PBKDF2 with SHA256.

### POST /settings/passphrase (form)

The user can send its new hashed passphrase (base64 encoded) to finish the
onboarding. The registration token can only be used once.

The `key` is the encryption key for bitwarden, encrypted with the master key.
The `public_key` and `private_key` are the key pair for sharing data with a
bitwarden organization, and they are optional.

#### Request

```http
POST /settings/passphrase HTTP/1.1

Host: alice.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json

```

### PUT /settings/passphrase (without two-factor authentication)

The user can change its passphrase with this route.

For users with two-factor authentication activated, a second step on the same
route is necessary to actually update the passphrase. See below.

#### Request

```http
PUT /settings/passphrase HTTP/1.1
Host: alice.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Cookie: cozysessid=AAAAAFhSXT81MWU0ZTBiMzllMmI1OGUyMmZiN2Q0YTYzNDAxN2Y5NjCmp2Ja56hPgHwufpJCBBGJC2mLeJ5LCRrFFkHwaVVa
```

```json

    "iterations": 10000
}
```

#### Response

```http

```

### PUT /settings/passphrase (with two-factor authentication)

The user can change its passphrase with this route, with two-factor
authentication to verify the user with more than its passphrase.

#### Request (first step)

```http
PUT /settings/passphrase HTTP/1.1
Host: alice.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Cookie: cozysessid=AAAAAFhSXT81MWU0ZTBiMzllMmI1OGUyMmZiN2Q0YTYzNDAxN2Y5NjCmp2Ja56hPgHwufpJCBBGJC2mLeJ5LCRrFFkHwaVVa
```

```json
{
    "current_passphrase": "4f58133ea0f415424d0a856e0d3d2e0cd28e4358fce7e333cb524729796b2791"
}
```

#### Response (first step)

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Set-Cookie: cozysessid=AAAAShoo3uo1Maic4VibuGohlik2eKUyMmZiN2Q0YTYzNDAxN2Y5NjCmp2Ja56hPgHwufpJCBBGJC2mLeJ5LCRrFFkHwaVVa; Path=/; Domain=alice.example.com; Max-Age=604800; HttpOnly; Secure
```

```json
{
    "two_factor_token": "YxOSUjxd0SNmuwEEDRHXfw=="
}
```

At this point, the current passphrase has been exchanged against a token, and a
passcode should have been sent to the user to authenticate on the second step.

The token/passcode pair can be used on the second step to update the passphrase.

#### Request (second step)

```http
PUT /settings/passphrase HTTP/1.1
Host: alice.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Cookie: cozysessid=AAAAAFhSXT81MWU0ZTBiMzllMmI1OGUyMmZiN2Q0YTYzNDAxN2Y5NjCmp2Ja56hPgHwufpJCBBGJC2mLeJ5LCRrFFkHwaVVa
```

```json
{
    "new_passphrase": "2e7e1e04300356adc8fabf5d304b58c564399746cc7a21464fd6593edd925720",
    "key": "0.uRcMe+Mc2nmOet4yWx9BwA==|PGQhpYUlTUq/vBEDj1KOHVMlTIH1eecMl0j80+Zu0VRVfFa7X/MWKdVM6OM/NfSZicFEwaLWqpyBlOrBXhR+trkX/dPRnfwJD2B93hnLNGQ=",
    "iterations": 10000,
    "two_factor_token": "YxOSUjxd0SNmuwEEDRHXfw==",
    "two_factor_passcode": "4947178"
}
```

#### Response (second step)

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Set-Cookie: cozysessid=AAAAShoo3uo1Maic4VibuGohlik2eKUyMmZiN2Q0YTYzNDAxN2Y5NjCmp2Ja56hPgHwufpJCBBGJC2mLeJ5LCRrFFkHwaVVa; Path=/; Domain=alice.example.com; Max-Age=604800; HttpOnly; Secure
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

    }
}
```

#### Permissions

To use this endpoint, an application needs a permission on the type
`io.cozy.settings` for the verb `PUT`.

### PUT /settings/instance/auth_mode

With this route, the user can ask for the activation of different authentication
modes, like two-factor authentication.

Available authentication modes:

-   `basic`: basic authentication only with passphrase
-   `two_factor_mail`: authentication with passphrase and validation with a code
    sent via email to the user.

When asking for activation of the two-factor authentication, a side-effect can
be triggered to send the user its code (via email for instance), and the
activation not being effective. This side-effect should provide the user with a
code that can be used to finalize the activation of the two-factor
authentication.

Hence, this route has two behaviors:

-   the code is not provided: the route is a side effect to ask for the
    activation of 2FA, and a code is sent
-   the code is provided, and valid: the two-factor authentication is actually
    activated.

Status codes:

-   `204 No Content`: when the mail has been confirmed and two-factor
    authentication is activated
-   `422 Unprocessable Entity`: when the given confirmation code is not good.

#### Request

```http
PUT /settings/instance/auth_mode HTTP/1.1
Host: alice.example.com

    "auth_mode": "two_factor_mail",
    "two_factor_activation_code": "12345678"
}
```

### PUT /settings/instance/sign_tos

With this route, an OAuth client can sign the new TOS version.

Status codes:

-   `204 No Content`: when the mail has been confirmed and two-factor
    authentication is activated

#### Request

```http
PUT /settings/instance/sign_tos HTTP/1.1
Host: alice.example.com
